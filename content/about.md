My name is Emre Colakoglu and I'm a product manager / experienced data analyst working in the intersection of gaming, analytics and automation.

I'll use this website to collect all of my favourite things and my writings.

I'm a product manager working on data and machine learning products at [Coda Platform](http://www.codaplatform.com). We are building smart products for mobile game creators to take the guesswork out of building successful mobile games. I joined Coda as first employee. We are based in London with offices in Istanbul and Ankara. Over the past decade, I worked at companies like [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com) and [Peak Games](http://www.peak.com).

I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. At age 18 I moved to [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble) where I studied Electrical Engineering. Since 2013, I call London, home.
